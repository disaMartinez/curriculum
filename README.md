# Hypermedia project hand-in

Part 1: Create your CV website

**Project Analysis:**

- Target user profile: The target audience for my website comprises tech employers and recruiters seeking to hire a programmer or engineer. They are looking for detailed information about my programming skills, proficiency in coding languages, and a list of tech projects I have been involved in. This should include my tech-related work experience, such as internships and freelance projects. Additionally, they may want to explore my educational background, including the university I'm attending and relevant coursework. Finally, I anticipate that these users would be interested in checking my professional profiles on platforms like GitHub.
- Information architecture: The primary focus will be on presenting the essential information about my skills, experience, and portfolio in a clear and concise manner on a single, easy-to-navigate page.
- Visual design: I've decided for black and dark tones on the webpage as I was inspired to create a CV theme suggestive of the Matrix.
- Other: I've used Visual Studio Code to create the HTML and CSS webpage with the assistance of the [W3Schools ](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)website.
